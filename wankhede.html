                <div id="maincontent">The Wankhede Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai. The stadium
                    now
                    has a capacity of 33,108, following renovations for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Before the upgrade,
                    the
                    capacity was approximately 45,000. The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket
                    matches in
                    the past, most notably the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and
                    became
                    the first country to win the cricket world cup on home soil. The stadium played host to the last
                    match
                    of Sachin Tendulkar's international career. Additionally, it has hosted many matches during the 1996
                    and
                    2011 Cricket World Cups. The stadium also played host to the match in which Ravi Shastri hit six
                    sixes
                    in an over of Tilak Raj</div>
